## Overview

## Objective
This project is the last lab assignment of ECE6100. The objective is to implement multi-level cache simulator with DRAM-based main memory. And this implementation will be extended to incorporate multiple cores, where each core has a private L1 (I and D) cache, and a shared L2 cache. Cache misses and writebacks from the shared L2 cache are serviced by a DRAM-based main memory consisting of 8 banks and per-bank row buffers.

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Design a standalone cache module
### Phase 2: Multi-level cache  
### Phase 3: Simple DRAM 
### Phase 4: Multicore system
### Phase 5: Static way partitioning
